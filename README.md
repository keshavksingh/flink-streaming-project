# Learning Flink - Streaming 
This is is a FLINK 1.16 Compiled Scala Repository. It enables a great jump start to Flink. The referrence book for the Audience would be - "Stream Processing with Apache Flink: Fundamentals, Implementation, and Operation of Streaming Applications" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/149197429X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, however the code examples are largely obselete since they have been complied on Flink v1.7.

This current repository aims to ease the struggle of the audience in their learning journey by providing Flink 1.16 scala code. 

Derived sections from https://github.com/luweizheng/flink-tutorials and upgraded, compiled from FLink v1.11 to Flink 1.16.
