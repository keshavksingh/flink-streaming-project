# Learning Flink - Streaming 
This is a FLINK 1.16 Compiled Scala 2.12.7 Repository. It enables a great jump start to Flink. The referrence book for the Audience would be - **Stream Processing with Apache Flink: Fundamentals, Implementation, and Operation of Streaming Applications** https://a.co/d/byvnMOM, however the code examples on this book are largely obselete since they have been complied on Flink v1.7.

This current repository (is NOT of/from the book), it aims to bridge the struggle of the audience in their learning journey by providing Flink 1.16 scala code. 

Some Sections are derived from https://github.com/luweizheng/flink-tutorials and upgraded, compiled from FLink v1.11 to Flink 1.16. 
Please refer POM for additional details.
